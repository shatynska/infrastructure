## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ansible Configuration Is Verified in Continuous Integration
Every pull request that changes files under `ansible/` SHALL trigger continuous-integration checks over that configuration. Verification SHALL be split into two tiers by cost and by confidence in the check itself.

**Blocking tier.** `ansible-lint` and `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` SHALL run as part of the required pull request status check, using the same invocation the repository's `pre-commit` configuration uses locally, so that a pull request cannot merge with Ansible content that fails either. These checks require no container runtime and no credential.

**Advisory tier.** The Molecule suite SHALL run in continuous integration on pull requests changing `ansible/`, and SHALL NOT be registered as a required status check while its behavior on a hosted runner is unestablished. Its scenarios exercise host-level firewalling, `fail2ban` and service management inside containers; whether every scenario is reproducible on a containerised runner has never been observed. An advisory result makes that observable without a failure of the runner environment blocking every merge.

The Molecule run SHALL discover role scenarios rather than enumerate them, so that a role or scenario added under `ansible/roles/` is covered without a workflow edit, and SHALL execute every scenario a role declares rather than only its `default` scenario.

Discovery SHALL fail loudly rather than succeed vacuously: where it finds no role to run, the run SHALL fail with a message identifying discovery as the cause, and SHALL NOT report success. A discovery that silently matches nothing is indistinguishable from a suite that passed, which is the same defect this capability's destroy-policy gate and secret scanning requirements each forbid elsewhere.

The Molecule run SHALL install its toolchain from the repository's exact pinned manifests — `ansible/requirements-test.txt` for the Python toolchain and `ansible/requirements.yml` for Galaxy content — and SHALL NOT resolve any dependency version freshly at run time.

That obligation SHALL extend to the container image each scenario executes inside, which is as much a run-time-resolved dependency as either manifest and determines what the pinned toolchain runs against. Every scenario SHALL declare its platform image by immutable content digest, so that every machine resolves the same immutable reference and an upstream re-push of a tag cannot change what the suite tested without a reviewable commit. Where the image publishes no version tag, the digest is the only exact form available and SHALL be used; where a multi-architecture image is published, the digest declared SHALL be the multi-architecture one, so that each architecture resolves deterministically beneath a single pinned reference rather than the pin excluding an architecture the suite is expected to run on.

Where two scenarios name the same image repository, they SHALL name the same digest. Scenarios are defined one per file with no shared inclusion, so a pin repeated across them drifts when one is refreshed and the others are not — leaving the suite running against two versions of the same image while appearing pinned. This constrains only scenarios that already agree on an image; it does not require the suite to standardise on a single base image.

A scenario SHALL NOT be exempt from this by being newly added: the obligation is over every scenario this repository authors, and a scenario reintroducing a mutable tag, or disagreeing with its siblings' digest, SHALL fail the pipeline's own configuration checks rather than being caught by review alone.

The obligation SHALL NOT extend to scenarios shipped by Galaxy content installed from `ansible/requirements.yml`, which install beside this repository's own roles and are not committed here. Such content is already pinned as a whole by that manifest, and its scenario definitions are neither editable in place — a reinstall discards local edits — nor reachable by review. The check SHALL derive that exclusion from the manifest's own contents rather than from a hardcoded list of role names, so that adding or removing pinned Galaxy content cannot leave the exclusion stale in either direction.

Neither tier SHALL declare a deployment `environment:` or receive any production credential; the Molecule suite runs offline against local containers.

#### Scenario: Ansible-only pull request is linted and syntax-checked
- **WHEN** a pull request changes a file under `ansible/` and no Terraform file
- **THEN** the required status check SHALL run `ansible-lint` and `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` and SHALL fail if either reports an error

#### Scenario: A newly added role scenario runs without a workflow change
- **WHEN** a pull request adds a scenario directory under `ansible/roles/<role>/molecule/`, and no change is made to the workflow to name that role or scenario
- **THEN** the Molecule run SHALL still execute that scenario

#### Scenario: Every scenario a role declares is executed
- **WHEN** the Molecule run reaches a role that declares more than one scenario
- **THEN** it SHALL execute all of that role's scenarios, not only the `default` scenario

#### Scenario: Discovering no roles fails rather than passes
- **WHEN** the Molecule run's role discovery yields an empty set
- **THEN** the run SHALL fail with a message identifying discovery as the cause, rather than concluding successfully having executed no scenario

#### Scenario: A failing Molecule scenario does not block a merge
- **WHEN** a Molecule scenario fails on a pull request
- **THEN** the failure SHALL be visible on the pull request, and the required status checks SHALL be unaffected by it

#### Scenario: Ansible verification receives no production credential
- **WHEN** any Ansible verification job runs on a pull request
- **THEN** it SHALL complete without a Hetzner API token, an SSH deploy key, a registry credential, or a declared deployment `environment:`

#### Scenario: Every scenario's platform image is pinned by digest
- **WHEN** the pipeline's own configuration checks read every scenario definition this repository authors under `ansible/roles/*/molecule/`
- **THEN** every declared platform image SHALL carry an immutable content digest, and a scenario declaring an image by mutable tag alone SHALL fail those checks

#### Scenario: A scenario declaring no platform image fails rather than being skipped
- **WHEN** those checks reach a scenario definition that declares no platform, or a platform with no image
- **THEN** the checks SHALL fail identifying that scenario, rather than passing over it — a scenario silently exempted from a pinning check is indistinguishable from a scenario that satisfies it

#### Scenario: Scenarios sharing an image repository agree on its digest
- **WHEN** two or more scenario definitions name the same image repository
- **THEN** they SHALL name the same digest, and a partial refresh leaving one at a different digest SHALL fail those checks

#### Scenario: Installed Galaxy content is not held to this repository's pinning obligation
- **WHEN** Galaxy content pinned in `ansible/requirements.yml` is installed into `ansible/roles/` and ships a scenario definition of its own
- **THEN** those checks SHALL exclude it, deriving the exclusion from that manifest, and SHALL report the same result on a provisioned developer machine as on a continuous-integration runner that has installed nothing

#### Scenario: An upstream re-push cannot change what the suite ran against
- **WHEN** the upstream registry re-publishes the tag a scenario's image was originally named by, and no commit is made to this repository
- **THEN** the scenario SHALL continue to resolve the same image content it resolved before the re-push
